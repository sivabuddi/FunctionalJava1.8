Some of the important Java 8 features are;

forEach() method in Iterable interface
default and static methods in Interfaces
Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions
Java Stream API for Bulk Data Operations on Collections
Java Time API
Collection API improvements
Concurrency API improvements
Java IO improvements


1. forEach() method in Iterable interface

Whenever we need to traverse through a Collection, we need to create an Iterator whose whole purpose
is to iterate over, and then we have business logic in a loop for each of the elements in the Collection.
We might get ConcurrentModificationException if the iterator is not used properly.

Java 8 has introduced forEach method in java.lang.Iterable interface so that while writing
code we focus on business logic. The forEach method takes java.util.function.Consumer object as an argument,
so it helps in having our business logic at a separate location that we can reuse. Letâ€™s see forEach usage
with a simple example.


Note: The number of lines might increase but forEach method helps in having the logic for iteration and
business logic at separate place resulting in higher separation of concern and cleaner code.
