Need of concurrent collections:

1) Most of the traditional collections are not Thread safe due to his it leads to
data consistency problems. (Thread safe allows only one thread to perform operations on
collections at a time. It will never allow you  second thread on collections until
first thread completed).
for instance ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, TreeSet etc..

2) Vector, Hashtable (These are traditional thread safe collections),
Collections.synchronizedMap, Collections.synchronizedSet, Collections.synchronizedList.
Problem with these collections, waiting time is more when more than one thread is operating on
collections.

3) Traditional collections 90 percent of them are not Thread safe(it leads to data consistency),
even few of traditional collections which provides thread safe it creates waiting time
problems.

4) While iterating collection object using Thread 1, If Thread 2 try to modify the structual modification
on collection object that is performed by Thread 1 then  Iterator fails and raise an
exception called ConcurrentModificationException.

5) Due to reason 4 mentioned above , traditional collection objects are not
suitable for multithreaded scalable applications.

6) ConcurrentModificationException is most common problem for all traditional collection objects.

7) To overcome all the problems we need to move concurrent collections framework.
