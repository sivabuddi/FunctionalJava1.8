// If you are familiar with factory design pattern in java, you will notice that we have a
// single Factory class. This factory class returns different subclasses based on the input
// provided and factory class uses if-else or switch statement to achieve this. In the Abstract
// Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each subclass.
// Then an Abstract Factory class that will return the subclass based on the input factory
// class. At first, it seems confusing but once you see the implementation, itâ€™s really easy
// to grasp and understand the minor difference between Factory and Abstract Factory pattern.
// Like our factory pattern post, we will use the same superclass and subclasses.
